# 001 - Intermittent 503s from EU edge

**Summary:**  
Users in EU reported intermittent `503` responses for `/api/v1/search`. US users unaffected.

**Steps to reproduce:**  
1. `curl -I https://example-customer.com/api/v1/search?q=test` (from EU) -> intermittent 503.  
2. `curl -I https://example-customer.com/api/v1/search?q=test` (from US) -> 200 OK.  
3. `dig +short example-customer.com` -> IPs: 23.192.228.80, 23.192.228.84, ...  
4. `mtr -r -c 10 example-customer.com` (from EU test instance) -> packet loss starting at hop 7.

**Findings:**  
- 503s correlated to traffic served from edge-group EU-1.  
- Origin logs show healthy responses and no 5xx on origin.  
- MTR shows packet loss at transit provider hop, consistent with transient routing issues.

**Action taken:**  
- Provided relevant `mtr`/`traceroute` output and sample `curl` responses to Networking team.  
- Suggested temporary failover configuration for EU edge or announce alternate POP(s).

**Resolution:**  
Transit provider applied a fix. Post-fix validation from EU instances shows 200 OK and no packet loss.

**Attachments:**  
- `curl` response snippets  
- `mtr` trace file (pasted or attached)
